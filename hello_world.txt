Git development began in April 2005 after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to Bitkeepr, 
a proprietary source control management system that had previoulsy been used to maintain the project. The 
copyright holder of Bitkeeper, larry McVoy, had withdrawn gratis use of the product after claiming that Andrew
Tridgell had reverse-engineered the Bitkeeper protocols. Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use
like Bitkeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs, particularly in terms of performance. 
Torvalds took an example of an SCM system requiring thirty seconds to apply a patch and update all associate
metadata, and noted that this would not scale to the needs of Linux kernel development, where syncing whith

The first merge of multiple branches was done on 18 April. Torvalds achived his performance goals; on 29 April
the nascent Git was benchmarked recording patches to the Linux kernel tree at the rate of 6.7 per second
On 16 June Git managed the kernel 2.6.12 release. Torvalds turned over maintenance on 26 july 2005
to Junio Hamano, a major contributor to the project. Hamano was responsible for the 1.0 release on 21 Dec 2005,
and remains the project's maintainer.
